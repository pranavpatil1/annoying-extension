# annoying extension

A fun little extension with slightly annoying functionality. good for pranks and parties (I'm guessing)

When the user opens a new tab, there's some animated text that pauses when the user hovers over the page. 

The background functionality is meant to start slowly moving the page when the user stops hovering over the page (for example to switch tabs)
